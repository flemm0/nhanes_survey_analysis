# Food Survey (What We Eat In America) Investigation

In this project, I analyzed dietary interview [data](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group/docs/wweia-documentation-and-data-sets/) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, also known as NHANES. The goal for this analysis was to investigate the factors that affect peoples' consumption of high amounts of sugar and saturated fatty acids. According to articles published by the CDC on diabetes, people should be wary of continued consumption of foods containing high amounts of these ingredients, as they contribute to the development of insulin resistance and prediabetes.
