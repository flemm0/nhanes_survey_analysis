Hello, my name is Flemming Wu. At the time of publishing this website, I am finishing up my first semester as a masters student in bioinformatics at the University of Southern California. I completed my undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego with a bachelors in biochemistry and cell biology. I got started on my path in bioinformatics during the last year of my undergraduate degree, where I took a few courses that allowed me to see how powerful computational tools are in aiding biomedical research. Since then, I've took it upon myself to learn as much as I can about the world of bioinformatics and computational biology!
